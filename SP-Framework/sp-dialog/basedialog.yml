      The base class for implementing dialogs in SharePoint Framework. This provides a supported way for showing dialogs
      to the user inside SharePoint Framework components.
    remarks: >-
      Extend this class to create dialogs for SharePoint Framework. By following the guidelines in implementation, the
      framework can ensure that the dialogs are shown in a user-friendly manner. While the content of the dialog is
      controlled by this class by implementing the render method, the framework can decide when to show the dialog and
      how to render the overlay and modal. The application on the page can also have control on allowing dialogs to
      show. Refer to the documentation of the individual methods and properties to learn more about how to extend and
      use this class.

    summary: Constructor for the `BaseDialog` class.
    remarks: >-
      It is important to keep the constructor lightweight. Use `onBeforeOpen()` for doing heavy-weight initialization
      that is needed for rendering the dialog such as resource allocations and asynchronous calls to fetch data. You can
      use the constructor to set initial parameters of your dialog such as references to resources in your application.
      The reason for this is that dialogs are usually constructed upon a UI event e.g. a button click, but the dialog
      may not always be shown right after construction. Keeping the constructor lightweight ensures smooth user
      experience and avoids doing throw-away work in case the dialog is not shown later e.g. if the framework rejects
      it. Another benefit of doing this is avoiding memory leaks by doing all the allocations and disposals in symmetric
      `onBeforeOpen()` and `onAfterClose()` events. If you allocate resources in the constructor, you have a memory leak
      because there is no guarantee onAfterClose() will get called, and onAfterClose() is your only opportunity to
      dispose.


      Example:


      ```
        constructor(cacheReference: any) {
          super();

          this._cache = cacheReference; // This is okay. Keeping a reference to my internal cache.
          this._cache.refresh(); // This is bad practice.
          // If you need to refresh the cache (or fetch data) for rendering, do it in onBeforeOpen()
        }
      ```

      This will void the permission to show for this dialog. Every dialog should have a mechanism to eventually close to
      avoid blocking the user interface. If called on an inactive dialog it will abort the request to show.

    remarks: >-
      This happens when the dialog goes behind a secondary dialog. Note that this is different from closed, because the
      dialog still has the permission to show and will eventually unhide. This returns false if the dialog is closed.

      returns false when the dialog is hidden.

    summary: This method is called after the dialog is visually closed and gives an opportunity for doing clean up.
    remarks: >-
      The dialog lifecycle completes after closing and there should be no resources left inside the object. Even though
      the dialog may be revived again for a new lifecycle using show() method, this is considered a whole new lifecycle
      that should reallocate its own resources. If there are any resources that you would like to keep for multiple
      lifecycles, consider allocating it outside the dialog object and passing its reference to the dialog constructor.

  - uid: '@microsoft/sp-dialog!BaseDialog#render:member(1)'
    summary: Renders the contents of the dialog.
    remarks: >-
      The `render` method must be implemented to render the content of the dialog in the container element provided by
      the framework. Use `this.domElement` to access this container. The container is inside a modal rendered in the
      center of the page on top of a dark overlay.


      The render method is called once after the modal element is created and opened. It is recommended to use
      `onBeforeOpen()` for doing non-UI operations for your rendering that might take a long time. This will ensure that
      the framework can show a friendly UI such as a spinner to let the user know that the dialog is being prepared. If
      you choose to do your initialization or other costly operations inside render method, make sure to have a friendly
      UI so the user is informed about the state of your dialog. Otherwise, an empty element is shown to the user which
      is a bad user experience practice.

      a secondary dialog reject while there is already a secondary dialog showing. This property may be undefined if a
