      Alerts a message to the user with a user-friendly interface. Calling this method sends a request to application to
      show the alert dialog.



      ### Remarks


      There might be a delay until the dialog is approved and shown by the application, for example, if there is another
      dialog currently being shown. The returned promise resolves when the dialog is successfully shown and closed. The
      promise rejects if the application rejects the request for any reason.
