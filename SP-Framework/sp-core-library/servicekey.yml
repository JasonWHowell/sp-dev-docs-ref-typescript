    summary: >-
      The ServiceKey is a lookup key that is used when calling
      [ServiceScope.consume()](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceScope#consume:member(1)) to fetch a dependency.
    remarks: >-
      Every service key also provides a default implementation of the dependency, which will be automatically created in
      the root scope if the dependency is not found. Providing a default implementation ensures that new dependencies
      can be safely introduced without inadvertently breaking components that are loaded by an older host that does not
      provide the new dependency.

      If you want to specify custom constructor parameters, use
      [ServiceKey.createCustom()](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceKey.createCustom:member(1)) instead.

    summary: A unique identifier for this service key.
    remarks: >-
      This identifier is an automatically generated string that will be unique for the lifetime of the page. Callers
      should not make assumptions about the formatting of this string. It is currently based on a global counter, but
      this may change in the future.


      The ServiceScope uses this identifier internally as a dictionary key for finding services. The ServiceKey is meant
      to be unique, even if multiple instances of the same library are loaded on the same page, even if the same name
      was passed to ServiceKey.create(). This is because each call to ServiceKey.create() could potentially provide a
      different defaultCreator implementation, whereas one of the design goals of ServiceScope is that the order in
      which libraries are loaded should never affect the resulting tree of scopes.

    summary: The name of the service.
    remarks: >-
      This name is used for logging and diagnostic purposes only. To make it unique, the recommended convention is the
      package name, followed by a period, followed by the class or interface name.


      The system does not assume that this string is unique. Instead, the
      [ServiceKey.id](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceKey#id:member) is used wherever a lookup key is needed.
