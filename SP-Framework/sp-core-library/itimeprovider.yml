      This is a [ServiceScope](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceScope:class) contract for reading the system
      clock.
    remarks: >-
      This interface abstracts the functionality of the system time APIs for usage with a
      [ServiceScope](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!ServiceScope:class)<!-- -->. For example, a unit test might replace
      the default [TimeProvider](xref:@microsoft/sp-core-library!TimeProvider:class) service with a mock implementation
      that follows a manually incremented timeline, in order to ensure that test failures are always repeatable.
