      Representation of an event. It exposes an event that third parties can attach handlers to.
    remarks: >-
      When an event is raised, its handlers are executed synchronously. An event handler should not throw errors,
      although the system can recover from an error in a handler. Event handlers should be fast. If they need to do
      expensive operations, they should use Promises for that.

      Registers an event handler callback that will be invoked whenever the event occurs. The same object can add
      multiple event handlers to the same event.


      ### Remarks


      Since BaseComponent implements the IEventObserver interface, a web part or extension can pass itself as the
      observer. This will cause the event handler to be automatically unsubscribed when the web part or extension is
      disposed.
