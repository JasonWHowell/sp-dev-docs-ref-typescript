    summary: Represents a framework event that components can subscribe to.
    remarks: >-
      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
      create subclasses that extend the SPEvent class.


      Examples of events in a web application might include: the user clicking a button, the system navigating to
      another page, or an item being added/removed from an abstract collection. The SharePoint Framework represents
      events using instances of the SPEvent object, one for each kind of event. The SPEvent object is typically exposed
      as a property of an associated class (e.g. the button that can be clicked). When a component is interested in an
      event, it calls add() to register an event handler callback that will be invoked each time the event occurs. The
      handler receives an SPEventArgs parameter that may provide additional details about what happened. This is
      analogous to the browser's Document Object Model (DOM) events. The main difference is the ISPEventObserver
      feature, which tracks which component subscribed to each event, and automatically unsubscribes the handler when
      the component is disposed.


      When an event is raised, all handlers are invoked synchronously. The order in which event handlers are called is
      unspecified. The event handler callback must catch any exceptions that occur during processing; an uncaught
      exception will not prevent other handlers from executing, but it will be reported as a problem with the associated
      component.

    summary: Registers a callback that will be invoked whenever the event occurs.
    remarks: >-
      The same object can add multiple event handlers to the same event. Since BaseComponent implements the
      ISPEventObserver interface, a web part or extension can pass itself as the observer. This will cause the event
      handler to be automatically unsubscribed when the web part or extension is disposed.

            handler failed to catch an exception.
