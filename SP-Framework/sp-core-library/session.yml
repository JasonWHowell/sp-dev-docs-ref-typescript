    summary: A unique identifier for the current instance of the client-side application.
    remarks: >-
      A unique identifier used to correlate logging and other diagnostic information. Its lifetime persists for the
      duration of the client-side application instance, i.e. it begins with the server request that renders the page,
      and ends e.g. when the browser tab is closed or F5 is pressed to reload the page. Note that if the application's
      router supports in-place navigation (via the history.pushState() API), the application session persists across
      these transitions.

    summary: A unique identifier for the current page within the client-side application.
    remarks: >-
      A unique identifier used to correlate logging and other diagnostic information. Whereas the
      [Session.applicationId](xref:sp-core-library.Session.applicationId) tracks the entire lifetime of the client-side
      application instance, the pageId tracks an individual "page" that is rendered. 

       For example, suppose that the application initially loads PageA, then the user does in-place navigation (via the history.pushState() API) to PageB, then navigates back to PageA, and finally they close the browser tab. During this sequence, the applicationId will remain the same, however the pageId will change on each navigation. The 3 different pageId values are used by the diagnostics e.g. to track success/failure statistics for PageA independently of PageB. 

       The concept of a page is subjective and defined by the router for a particular application.
