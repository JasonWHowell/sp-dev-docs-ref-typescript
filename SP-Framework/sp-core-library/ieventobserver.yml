    summary: >-
      Used with the [Event](xref:sp-core-library.Event) system, this interface is implemented by components that can
      subscribe to events.
    remarks: >-
      IEventObserver is an abstraction of the key features that a component must have in order to subscribe to a
      SharePoint Framework event: It must have instanceId and componentId information for diagnostics reporting, and it
      must have a way to notify the event system when the component is disposed, so that its handlers can be
      automatically removed. Other objects may implement this contract, as long as they meet these requirements.
