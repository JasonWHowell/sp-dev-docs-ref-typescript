    summary: Represents a command belonging to a command set.
    remarks: >-
      The BaseListViewCommandSet extension type exposes generalized commands that may be displayed as tool bar buttons,
      context menu items, etc. These commands are initially defined in the extension's manifest file. At runtime, the
      corresponding Command object can be obtained by calling
      [BaseListViewCommandSet.tryGetCommand()](xref:@microsoft/sp-listview-extensibility!BaseListViewCommandSet%23tryGetCommand:member(1))<!--
      -->. The command's appearance can be customized by assigning its properties, for example to hide a command that is
      not contextually relevant, or to pluralize the title based on the number of selected items.

      Altering the title property is intended to allow minor changes to the title, e.g. “Submit these 3 items” or
      toggling between “Schedule” and “Unschedule”. Developers are discouraged from assigning a title that radically
      alters the meaning of the command, because administrators should be able to examine the extension manifest to
      understand which commands are being implemented by a given extension.
