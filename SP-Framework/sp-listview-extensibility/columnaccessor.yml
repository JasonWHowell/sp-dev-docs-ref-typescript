    summary: 'Provides access to a ListView column, which is the visual presentation of a field.'
    remarks: >-
      A SharePoint "field" (SPField) defines the data storage for a property of a list item. (If the list item
      represents a document, then the field is sometimes called a "property".)


      A "column" is the visual presentation of a field, when displayed by the ListView.


      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
      create subclasses that extend the `ColumnAccessor` class.
