      This is the base class that third parties should extend when implementing a client-side extension that customizes
      the appearance of fields in a SharePoint ListView.


      In the component manifest, the "extensionType" should be set to "FieldCustomizer".

    summary: Use the context object to access common services and state associated with the component.
    remarks: >-
      Child classes are expected to override this field by redeclaring it with a specialized type. It is meant to be a
      read-only property; the type cannot be declared as read-only in the base class (because it is initialized outside
      the constructor), but child classes should redeclare it as readonly.
