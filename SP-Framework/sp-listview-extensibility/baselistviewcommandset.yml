    summary: >-
      This is the base class that third parties should extend when implementing a client-side extension that provides a
      command set for a SharePoint list view.
    remarks: >-
      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
      create subclasses that extend the BaseListViewCommandSet class.


      In the component manifest, the "extensionType" should be set to "ListViewCommandSet".

    remarks: >-
      Child classes are expected to override this field by redeclaring it with a specialized type. It is meant to be a
      read-only property; the type cannot be declared as read-only in the base class (because it is initialized outside
      the constructor), but child classes should redeclare it as readonly.

    summary: This event occurs whenever the ListView state changes.
    remarks: >-
      This event allows the implementor to tailor the appearance of the command. For example, to hide the command,
      assign its property visible = false. To customize the title, modify the command property title.
