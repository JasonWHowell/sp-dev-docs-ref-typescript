    summary: Returns the SharePoint correlation ID.
    remarks: >-
      The correlation ID is a Guid that can be used to associate log events that are part of the same overall operation,
      but may originate from different services or components. SharePoint REST operations return the server's
      correlation ID as the "sprequestguid" header.
