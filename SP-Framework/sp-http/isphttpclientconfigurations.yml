    summary: Standard configurations for SPHttpClient.
    remarks: >-
      This interface provides standard predefined SPHttpClientConfiguration objects for use with the SPHttpClient class.
      In general, clients should choose the latest available version number, which enables all the switches that are
      recommended for typical scenarios. (If new switches are introduced in the future, a new version number will be
      introduced, which ensures that existing code will continue to function the way it did at the time when it was
      tested.)
