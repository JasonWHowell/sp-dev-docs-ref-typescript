summary: MSGraphClient is used to perform REST calls against Microsoft Graph.
remarks: >-
  The Microsoft Graph JavaScript client library is a lightweight wrapper around the Microsoft Graph API. This class
  allows developers to start making REST calls to MSGraph without needing to initialize the the MSGraph client library.
  If a custom configuration is desired, the MSGraphClient api function needs to be provided with that custom
  configuration for every request.
