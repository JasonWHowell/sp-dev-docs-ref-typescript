    summary: >-
      The SPHttpClientBatch class accumulates a number of REST service calls and transmits them as a single ODATA batch.
      This protocol is documented here: http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part1-protocol.html


      The usage is to call SPHttpClientBatch.fetch() to queue each individual request, and then call
      SPHttpClientBatch.execute() to execute the batch operation. The execute() method returns a promise that resolves
      when the real REST call has completed. Each call to fetch() also returns a promise that will resolve with an
      SPHttpClientResponse object for that particular request.
    remarks: >-
      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
      create subclasses that extend the SPHttpClientBatch class.

    summary: >-
      Queues a new request, and returns a promise that can be used to access the server response (after execute() has
      completed). The parameters for this function are basically the same as the WHATWG API standard documented here:
      https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/


      However, be aware that certain REST headers are ignored or not allowed inside a batch. See the ODATA documentation
      for details.


      When execute() is called, it will POST to a URL such as "http://example.com/sites/sample/\_api/$batch". Typically
      SPHttpClientBatch can successfully guess the appropriate SPWeb URL by looking for a reserved URL segment such as
      "\_api" in the first URL passed to fetch(). If not, use ISPHttpClientBatchCreationOptions.webUrl to specify it
      explicitly.
