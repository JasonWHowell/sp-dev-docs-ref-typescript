    summary: >-
      SPHttpClient is used to perform REST calls against SharePoint. It adds default headers, manages the digest needed
      for writes, and collects telemetry that helps the service to monitor the performance of an application.
    remarks: |-
      This class is marked as `@sealed`. Subclasses should not extend it.

      For communicating with other internet services, use the [HttpClient](xref:sp-http.HttpClient) class.

    remarks: >-
      Generally, the parameters and semantics for SPHttpClient.fetch() are essentially the same as the WHATWG API
      standard that is documented here: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/


      The SPHttpClient subclass adds some additional behaviors that are convenient when working with SharePoint ODATA
      API's (which can be avoided by using HttpClient instead):


      - Default "Accept" and "Content-Type" headers are added if not explicitly specified.


      - For write operations, an "X-RequestDigest" header is automatically added


      - The request digest token is automatically fetched and stored in a cache, with support for preloading


      For a write operation, SPHttpClient will automatically add the "X-RequestDigest" header, which may need to be
      obtained by issuing a seperate request such as "https://example.com/sites/sample/\_api/contextinfo". Typically the
      appropriate SPWeb URL can be guessed by looking for a reserved URL segment such as "\_api" in the original URL
      passed to fetch(); if not, use ISPHttpClientOptions.webUrl to specify it explicitly.

    summary: Use a heuristic to infer the base URL for authentication.
    remarks: >-
      Attempts to infer the SPWeb URL associated with the provided REST URL, by looking for common SharePoint path
      components such as "\_api", "\_layouts", or "\_vit\_bin". This is necessary for operations such as the
      X-RequestDigest and ODATA batching, which require POSTing to a separate REST endpoint in order to complete a
      request.


      For example, if the requestUrl is "/sites/site/web/\_api/service", the returned URL would be "/sites/site/web". Or
      if the requestUrl is "http://example.com/\_layouts/service", the returned URL would be "http://example.com".


      If the URL cannot be determined, an exception is thrown.
