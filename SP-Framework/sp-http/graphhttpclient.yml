    summary: >-
      GraphHttpClient is used to perform REST calls against Microsoft Graph. It adds default headers and collects
      telemetry that helps the service to monitor the performance of an application.

    remarks: >-
      This class is marked as `@sealed`. Subclasses should not extend it.


      For communicating with SharePoint, use the [SPHttpClient](xref:sp-http.SPHttpClient) class instead. For
      communicating with other internet services, use the [HttpClient](xref:sp-http.HttpClient) class instead.

    remarks: >-
      Generally, the parameters and semantics for HttpClient.fetch() are essentially the same as the WHATWG API standard
      that is documented here: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/


      The GraphHttpClient subclass adds some additional behaviors that are convenient when working with SharePoint ODATA
      API's (which can be avoided by using HttpClient instead): - Default "Accept" and "Content-Type" headers are added
      if not explicitly specified.
