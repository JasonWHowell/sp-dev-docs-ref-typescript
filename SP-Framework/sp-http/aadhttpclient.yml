      This class is marked as `@sealed`. Subclasses should not extend it.


      For communicating with SharePoint, use the [SPHttpClient](xref:@microsoft/sp-http!SPHttpClient:class) class
      instead. For communicating with Microsoft Graph, use the
      [MSGraphClient](xref:@microsoft/sp-http!MSGraphClient:class) class.
