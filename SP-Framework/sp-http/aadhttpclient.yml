    remarks: >-
      This class is marked as `@sealed`. Subclasses should not extend it.


      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
      create subclasses that extend the AadHttpClient class.


      For communicating with SharePoint, use the [SPHttpClient](xref:sp-http.SPHttpClient) class instead. For
      communicating with Microsoft Graph, use the [GraphHttpClient](xref:sp-http.GraphHttpClient) class.
