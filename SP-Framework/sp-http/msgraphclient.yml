    summary: MSGraphClient is used to perform REST calls against Microsoft Graph.
    remarks: >-
      The Microsoft Graph JavaScript client library is a lightweight wrapper around the Microsoft Graph API. This class
      allows developers to start making REST calls to MSGraph without needing to initialize the the MSGraph client
      library. If a custom configuration is desired, the MSGraphClient api function needs to be provided with that
      custom configuration for every request.

      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
      create subclasses that extend the `MSGraphClient` class.
