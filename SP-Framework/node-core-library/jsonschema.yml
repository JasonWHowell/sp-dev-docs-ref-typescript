      Represents a JSON schema that can be used to validate JSON data files loaded by the JsonFile class.
    remarks: >
      The schema itself is normally loaded and compiled later, only if it is actually required to validate an input. To
      avoid schema errors at runtime, it's recommended to create a unit test that calls JsonSchema.ensureCompiled() for
      each of your schema objects.
