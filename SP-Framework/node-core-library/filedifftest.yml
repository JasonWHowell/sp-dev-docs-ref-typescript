      Implements a unit testing strategy that generates output files, and then compares them against the expected input.
      If the files are different, then the test fails.

      Compares the contents of two files, and returns true if they are equivalent. Note that these files are not
      normally edited by a human; the "equivalence" comparison here is intended to ignore spurious changes that might be
      introduced by a tool, e.g. Git newline normalization or an editor that strips whitespace when saving.
