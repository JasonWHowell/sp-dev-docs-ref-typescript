      Compares the contents of two files, and returns true if they are equivalent. Note that these files are not
      normally edited by a human; the "equivalence" comparison here is intended to ignore spurious changes that might be
      introduced by a tool, e.g. Git newline normalization or an editor that strips whitespace when saving.
