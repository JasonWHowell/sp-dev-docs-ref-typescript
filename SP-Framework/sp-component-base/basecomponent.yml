    summary: 'Base class for client-side components such as BaseClientSideWebPart, BaseExtension, etc.'
    remarks: >-
      **Implements:** `IEventObserver`


      The constructor for this class is marked as internal; third party code should not inherit directly from this base
      class.

      Returns the component identifier as defined in the componentâ€™s associated manifest.


      ### Remarks


      Each client-side component has an associated manifest that is used by the sp-loader to load its scripts, and which
      may include additional metadata about the component. Manifests are tracked using a unique identifier, which is a
      text string containing a lower case GUID value

      Child classes are expected to override this field by redeclaring it with a specialized type. It is meant to be a
      read-only property; the type cannot be declared as read-only in the base class (because it is initialized outside
      the constructor), but child classes should redeclare it as readonly.

      Disposes the component. In order to write component-specific dispose mechanism, use onDispose instead. 

       The onDispose event should only be raised once - if this.\_disposed was false when the function was called. (Put another way, dispose() should be a no-op if this.\_disposed is true.)
