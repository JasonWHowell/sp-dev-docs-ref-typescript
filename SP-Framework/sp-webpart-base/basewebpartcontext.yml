    summary: >-
      Web part context object. This object contains the contextual services available to a web part. e.g. a contextual
      instance to the http client.


      This base is to be extended by UI-specific WebPart's base.
    remarks: >-
      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
      create subclasses that extend the BaseWebPartContext class.

      up different margins that when rendering in a canvas.
