    remarks: >
      A "context" object is a collection of well-known services and other objects that are likely to be needed by any
      business logic working with a component. Each component type has its own specialized extension of this interface,
      e.g. IWebPartContext for web parts, IExtensionContext for client-side extensions, etc.
