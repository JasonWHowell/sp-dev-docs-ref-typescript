    summary: SharePoint Framework core libraries.
    remarks: >-
      This package provides a foundation of core classes that ensure a consistent character across all the other
      SharePoint Framework APIs. Because this package is a dependency of every other package, its design prioritizes
      small code size and broad applicability, versus flexibility or richness of features.
