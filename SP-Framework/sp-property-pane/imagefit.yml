      The image will be centered horizontally and vertically within the frame and maintains its aspect ratio. It will
      behave as ImageFit.center if the image's natural height and width is less than the Image frame's height and width,
      but if either natural height or width are larger than the frame it will behave as ImageFit.contain.

      centered horizontally and vertically within the frame. The space in the top and bottom or in the sides of the
      frame will be empty depending on the difference in aspect ratio between the image and the frame.
