      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not call the constructor directly or
      create subclasses that extend the PlaceholderContent class.


      This object is returned by
      [PlaceholderProvider.tryCreateContent](xref:sp-application-base.PlaceholderProvider.tryCreateContent)<!-- -->. It
      provides access to a Document Object Model (DOM) element where the owner can render its custom content.

      This method can be called to immediately dispose the attached DOM element. Otherwise, it will be disposed by the
      application when the containing placeholder is disposed. Calling dispose() invokes the
      [IPlaceholderCreateContentOptions.onDispose](xref:sp-application-base.IPlaceholderCreateContentOptions.onDispose)
      callback, removes the associated DOM element from the page, and disposes the PlaceholderContent object.
