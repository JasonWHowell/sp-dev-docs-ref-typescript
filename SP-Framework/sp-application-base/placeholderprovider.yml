  - uid: sp-application-base.PlaceholderProvider
    summary: >-
      Allows third-party components to discover and use SharePoint placeholders. Placeholders enable third-party
      components to render custom content into designated regions on the page.
    remarks: >-
      The constructor for this class is marked as internal. Third-party code should not extend subclasses of the
      PlaceholderProvider class or instantiate it directly.


      Placeholders are designated regions on the page, identified by one of the predefined
      [PlaceholderName](xref:sp-application-base.PlaceholderName) constants. Different applications and pages might
      support different placeholder names. Placeholders can appear and disappear as the user interacts with the page,
      for example via in-place navigation. Third-party components should not assume that a given placeholder will always
      be available.


      Use [PlaceholderProvider.tryCreateContent](xref:sp-application-base.PlaceholderProvider.tryCreateContent) to test
      whether a placeholder is available and add content to it. Use the
      [PlaceholderProvider.changedEvent](xref:sp-application-base.PlaceholderProvider.changedEvent) event to discover
      when new placeholders appear.

  - uid: sp-application-base.PlaceholderProvider.changedEvent
    summary: This event is raised when the list of currently available placeholders is changed.
    remarks: >-
      The application can change its list of available placeholders at any time. This means that the existing
      placeholders may get disposed or new placeholders may be added. Use this event to discover new placeholders when
      they appear.

    summary: >-
      Tests whether the page contains the specified placeholder. If so, a new PlaceholderContent object is created,
      which allows the caller to render custom content inside the placeholder.
    remarks: >-
      The host application makes no guarantees about the availability of a given placeholder. In situations where an
      expected placeholder is not available, the third-party extension must handle it gracefully, e.g. by not rendering
      anything, or by choosing an alternative placeholder.
