      Allows third party components to discover and use "placeholders". Placeholders allow third party components to
      inject custom content into designated regions on the page.
    remarks: >-
      Placeholders are defined by the application. Different applications and pages support different placeholders, and
      placeholders can appear and disappear as the user interacts with the page, e.g. via in-place navigation. Third
      party components should not assume that a given placeholder will always be available. 

       Use [PlaceholderProvider.tryCreateContent](xref:sp-application-base.PlaceholderProvider.tryCreateContent) to test whether a placeholder is available and add content to it. Use the [PlaceholderProvider.changedEvent](xref:sp-application-base.PlaceholderProvider.changedEvent) to discover when new placeholders appear.

      This event is raised when the list of currently available placeholders is changed.


      ### Remarks


      The application can change its list of available placeholders at any time. This means that the existing
      placeholders may get disposed or new placeholders may be added. Use this event to discover new placeholders when
      they appear.

      Tests whether the page contains the specified placeholder. If so, a new PlaceholderContent object is created,
      which allows the caller to render custom content inside the placeholder.


      ### Remarks


      The host application makes no guarantees about the availability of a given placeholder. In situations where an
      expected placeholder is not available, the third party extension must handle it gracefully, e.g. by not rendering
      anything, or by choosing an alternative placeholder.
